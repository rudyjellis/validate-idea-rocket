## üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

### 1. iOS Tap to Record Button Not Working
**Commit**: `b20ec66`  
**Impact**: High - iOS users couldn't start recording

**Problem**: 
- Tap to record button was unresponsive on iOS devices
- Missing `onTouchEnd` event handler
- `onTapToRecord` handler not passed from MobileVideoRecorder to VideoPreview

**Fix**:
- Added `onTouchEnd` event handler to RecordButton component
- Added proper touch event handling with `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()`
- Added accessibility attributes (`role="button"`, `tabIndex`, `aria-label`)
- Disabled WebKit tap highlight for cleaner UX
- Connected handler chain: MobileVideoRecorder ‚Üí VideoPreview ‚Üí MobileControls ‚Üí RecordButton

**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/video-recorder/components/RecordButton.tsx`
- `src/components/video-recorder/components/MobileVideoRecorder.tsx`
- `src/components/video-recorder/components/video-preview/MobileControls.tsx`

---

### 2. Mobile Recording Controls Issues
**Commit**: `a1f28d4`  
**Impact**: High - Multiple UX issues on mobile

**Problems**:
1. Multiple pause/stop buttons displayed during recording (duplicate controls)
2. Download button missing after stopping recording
3. Download button visible during recording (should only show after)

**Root Causes**:
- Duplicate `MobileRecordingControls` rendered in both VideoPreview and MobileVideoRecorder
- `MobileRecordingControls` only showed when `recordingState === "recording"`
- Download button rendered alongside pause/stop buttons

**Fixes**:
- Removed duplicate `MobileRecordingControls` from MobileVideoRecorder
- Split control logic: recording state (pause/stop) vs idle-with-recording state (download)
- Added `hasRecording` prop to track when recording is available
- Download button now shows only after recording stops

**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/video-recorder/components/MobileRecordingControls.tsx`
- `src/components/video-recorder/components/MobileVideoRecorder.tsx`
- `src/components/video-recorder/VideoPreview.tsx`
- `src/components/video-recorder/components/video-preview/MobileControls.tsx`
- `src/components/video-recorder/RecordingControls.tsx`

---

### 3. Desktop Play Recording Button Unresponsive
**Commit**: `af45901`  
**Impact**: High - Desktop users couldn't play back recordings

**Problem**:
- Play button didn't respond to clicks after stopping recording
- `DesktopControls` had `hasRecording` hardcoded to `true`
- Missing prop chain for `hasRecording` and `onStartRecording`

**Fix**:
- Added `hasRecording` and `onStartRecording` props to DesktopControls
- Properly passed props through component hierarchy:
  - DesktopVideoRecorder ‚Üí VideoPreviewContainer ‚Üí VideoPreview ‚Üí DesktopControls
- Changed from hardcoded `hasRecording={true}` to dynamic prop
- Added proper handler fallbacks

**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/video-recorder/components/video-preview/DesktopControls.tsx`
- `src/components/video-recorder/VideoPreview.tsx`
- `src/components/video-recorder/components/desktop/VideoPreviewContainer.tsx`
- `src/components/video-recorder/components/DesktopVideoRecorder.tsx`

### 4. Black Video During Playback
**Commit**: `bb419e1`  
**Impact**: Critical - Users saw black screen instead of recorded video

**Problem**:
- VideoElement only handled MediaStream via `srcObject`
- Never set blob URL via `src` attribute for playback
- When clicking play, video element had no source

**Root Cause**:
- Recording mode uses `video.srcObject = MediaStream` (live camera)
- Playback mode needs `video.src = URL.createObjectURL(blob)` (recorded video)
- VideoElement didn't switch between these modes

**Fix**:
- Added `recordedBlob` prop to VideoElement
- Added `setVideoSource()` method to VideoElementRef
- New effect to handle playback mode:
  - When `isPlayingBack && recordedBlob`: Create blob URL and set as `video.src`
  - Clear `srcObject` and unmute video for playback
  - When switching back to stream: Clear `src` and restore stream mode
- Proper blob URL cleanup to prevent memory leaks

**Technical Details**:
- **Recording**: `video.srcObject = MediaStream` (muted, live)
- **Playback**: `video.src = URL.createObjectURL(blob)` (unmuted, recorded)
- **Blob Creation**: `new Blob(recordedChunks, { type: recordedChunks[0]?.type || 'video/webm' })`

**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/video-recorder/components/VideoElement.tsx`
- `src/components/video-recorder/VideoPreview.tsx`
- `src/components/video-recorder/components/desktop/VideoPreviewContainer.tsx`
- `src/components/video-recorder/components/MobileVideoRecorder.tsx`

---

### 5. Download Button Hidden During Playback
**Commit**: `0f3ef06`  
**Impact**: Medium - Users couldn't download while watching

**Problem**:
- Download button disappeared during video playback on desktop
- Condition was `hasRecording && !isPlayingBack`

**Fix**:
- Removed `!isPlayingBack` condition
- Download button now shows when `hasRecording` is true, regardless of playback state
- Users can download while watching the recording

**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/video-recorder/components/DesktopRecordingControls.tsx`
