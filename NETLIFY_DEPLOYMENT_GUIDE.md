# Netlify Serverless Functions - Deployment Guide

## üéâ Security Upgrade Complete!

Your API key is now **secure** and will never be exposed in the browser.

## What Changed?

### Before (Insecure ‚ùå):
```
Browser ‚Üí Anthropic API (with exposed key)
```
- API key visible in browser DevTools
- Anyone could steal your key
- Security risk in production

### After (Secure ‚úÖ):
```
Browser ‚Üí Netlify Function ‚Üí Anthropic API
         (API key hidden)
```
- API key stored server-side only
- Never exposed to users
- Production-ready and secure

## Files Created

### 1. Netlify Configuration
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify build and function settings

### 2. Serverless Functions
- `netlify/functions/upload-video.js` - Handles video upload to Anthropic
- `netlify/functions/generate-mvp.js` - Generates MVP document with Claude

### 3. Updated Frontend
- `src/services/anthropic.ts` - Now calls Netlify functions instead of Anthropic directly

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement secure Netlify serverless functions for Anthropic API"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Configure Netlify Environment Variable

1. Go to your Netlify dashboard: https://app.netlify.com/
2. Select your site
3. Go to **Site Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
4. Click **Add a variable**
5. Add:
   - **Key**: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: `your_anthropic_api_key_here` (get from https://console.anthropic.com/)
   - **Scopes**: All (Production, Deploy Previews, Branch Deploys)
6. Click **Create variable**

### Step 3: Redeploy

After adding the environment variable:
1. Go to **Deploys** tab
2. Click **Trigger deploy** ‚Üí **Deploy site**
3. Wait for deployment to complete

### Step 4: Test

1. Visit your deployed site
2. Record a video
3. Click the orange Upload button
4. Verify it uploads and generates MVP document

## Local Development

### Option 1: Netlify CLI (Recommended)

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI globally
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Link to your site
netlify link

# Run dev server with functions
netlify dev
```

This will:
- Run your app on http://localhost:8888
- Run Netlify functions locally
- Load environment variables from Netlify

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. Create `.env` file (already done):
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

2. Run regular dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Note: Functions won't work locally without Netlify CLI, but you can still develop the UI.

## Verification

### Check API Key is NOT Exposed

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console
3. Type: `import.meta.env.VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
4. Should return: `undefined` ‚úÖ

The key is now only on the server!

### Check Functions Work

1. Record a video
2. Click Upload button
3. Check Network tab in DevTools
4. Should see requests to:
   - `/.netlify/functions/upload-video`
   - `/.netlify/functions/generate-mvp`

## Troubleshooting

### Functions Not Found (404)

- Make sure you've pushed to GitHub
- Verify `netlify.toml` is in the root
- Check Netlify build logs for errors
- Redeploy the site

### API Key Error

- Verify environment variable is set in Netlify dashboard
- Check the variable name is exactly: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- Make sure you redeployed after adding the variable

### Upload Fails

- Check Netlify function logs in dashboard
- Verify API key is valid at https://console.anthropic.com/
- Check file size (must be < 30MB)

## Cost & Limits

### Netlify Functions (Free Tier)
- 125,000 function requests/month
- 100 hours runtime/month
- More than enough for testing and small-scale use

### Anthropic API
- Charges based on tokens used
- Check your usage at https://console.anthropic.com/

## Security Benefits

‚úÖ **API Key Protected** - Never exposed to browser
‚úÖ **Server-Side Only** - Runs in secure Netlify environment  
‚úÖ **Rate Limiting** - Can add rate limiting to functions
‚úÖ **User Tracking** - Can track usage per user
‚úÖ **Production Ready** - Safe to deploy publicly

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Push code to GitHub
2. ‚úÖ Add environment variable in Netlify
3. ‚úÖ Redeploy site
4. ‚úÖ Test upload functionality
5. ‚úÖ Monitor function logs in Netlify dashboard
