ðŸ”§ VIDEO STREAM FIX APPLIED

PROBLEM:
- Video preview was black during recording
- Stream was created but never attached to video element
- VideoElement component had no way to receive the stream

SOLUTION:
1. Added stream state management to useMediaStream hook
2. Exposed currentStream through the hook chain:
   - useMediaStream â†’ useVideoRecording â†’ useRecorderLogic
3. Updated VideoElement to accept and attach stream prop
4. Passed stream down through component tree:
   - DesktopVideoRecorder â†’ VideoPreviewContainer â†’ VideoPreview â†’ VideoElement
   - MobileVideoRecorder â†’ VideoPreview â†’ VideoElement

CHANGES MADE:
âœ… useMediaStream.ts - Added currentStream state
âœ… useVideoRecording.ts - Exposed currentStream
âœ… useRecorderLogic.ts - Passed currentStream through
âœ… VideoElement.tsx - Added stream prop and attachment logic
âœ… VideoPreview.tsx - Added currentStream prop
âœ… VideoPreviewContainer.tsx - Passed currentStream
âœ… DesktopVideoRecorder.tsx - Passed currentStream
âœ… MobileVideoRecorder.tsx - Passed currentStream

RESULT:
- Video preview now shows live camera feed during recording
- Stream properly attached when recording starts
- Stream cleared when recording stops
