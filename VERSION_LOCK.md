## Critical Files (Do Not Modify Without Testing)

### Camera Handling
```
src/components/video-recorder/hooks/useCameraDevices.ts
```
**Why Critical**: Handles camera permission flow. Changes can break device enumeration.

### Video Recorder Core
```
src/components/video-recorder/VideoRecorder.tsx
src/components/video-recorder/components/MobileVideoRecorder.tsx
src/components/video-recorder/components/DesktopVideoRecorder.tsx
```
**Why Critical**: Core video recording functionality. Well-tested and working.

### Test Configuration
```
vitest.config.ts
src/test/setup.ts
src/test/utils.tsx
```
**Why Critical**: Test infrastructure. Changes can break all tests.

## Known Working Browser Configurations

### Desktop
- ✅ Chrome 120+ (Tested)
- ✅ Edge 120+ (Expected to work)
- ⚠️ Firefox 120+ (Should work, test before deploying)
- ⚠️ Safari 17+ (May have quirks, test thoroughly)

### Mobile
- ✅ Chrome Mobile (Android) - Tested
- ⚠️ Safari Mobile (iOS) - Test required

---

## Rollback Instructions

If something breaks after changes:

### Quick Rollback
```bash
git reset --hard 3ee0604
npm ci  # Reinstall exact dependency versions
npm test -- --run  # Verify tests pass
npm run dev  # Start dev server
```

### Verify Rollback Success
1. All 42 tests should pass
2. Camera permissions should work
3. Video recording should function
4. No console errors on page load

---

## Safe Update Procedures

### Before Making Changes

1. **Create a new branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Run full test suite**
   ```bash
   npm test -- --run
   npm run test:coverage
   ```

3. **Test in browser**
   - Grant camera permissions
   - Record a video
   - Play it back
   - Download the video

### After Making Changes

1. **Run tests again**
   ```bash
   npm test -- --run
   ```

2. **Check for regressions**
   - Camera still works?
   - Recording still works?
   - Tests still pass?

3. **Update snapshots if needed**
   ```bash
   npm test -- -u
   ```

4. **Commit with descriptive message**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "feat: describe your changes"
   ```

## Dependency Update Strategy

### Safe to Update (Low Risk)
- Documentation packages
- Development tools (prettier, etc.)
- Minor version bumps of UI components

### Update with Caution (Medium Risk)
- Testing libraries (run full test suite after)
- Build tools (vite, typescript)
- State management libraries

### Do Not Update Without Thorough Testing (High Risk)
- React/React-DOM (major versions)
- Vitest (can break test configuration)
- MediaRecorder API dependencies
- Camera/video related packages

---

## Environment Variables

Currently none required for core functionality.

Future additions should be documented here.

---

## Performance Benchmarks (Baseline)

### Test Suite
- **Duration**: ~3-4 seconds
- **Tests**: 42 passing
- **Coverage**: Focus on critical paths

### Build Times
- **Dev Server Start**: ~2-3 seconds
- **Production Build**: TBD
- **HMR Update**: <500ms

---

## Monitoring & Alerts

### What to Monitor
1. Test pass rate (should be 100%)
2. Camera permission grant rate
3. Video recording success rate
4. Browser console errors

### Red Flags
- ❌ Tests failing
- ❌ Camera permission errors
- ❌ "empty deviceId" warnings
- ❌ MediaRecorder errors
- ❌ Build failures

---
