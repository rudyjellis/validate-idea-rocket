# Anthropic API Configuration (for Netlify Functions)
# Get your API key from: https://console.anthropic.com/

# IMPORTANT: This file is for reference only
# The API key should be set in Netlify's environment variables dashboard
# NOT in .env.local (which was insecure)

# For local development with Netlify CLI:
# Create a .env file (gitignored) with:
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here

# For production deployment:
# 1. Go to Netlify Dashboard → Site Settings → Environment Variables
# 2. Add: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = your_anthropic_api_key_here
# 3. Redeploy your site

# Note: We removed VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY because it exposed the key in the browser
# Now using secure Netlify serverless functions instead
