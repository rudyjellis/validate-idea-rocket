# API Configuration (for Netlify Functions)
# IMPORTANT: This file is for reference only
# API keys should be set in Netlify's environment variables dashboard
# NOT in .env.local (which was insecure)

# ============================================
# Anthropic API (Claude)
# ============================================
# Get your API key from: https://console.anthropic.com/

# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here

# Notes
# ============================================
# - We removed VITE_* prefixed keys because they exposed keys in the browser
# - Now using secure Netlify serverless functions instead
# - Both API keys are required for full functionality:
#   * ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: Required for MVP generation
#   * OPENAI_API_KEY: Required for audio transcription
